Code Examples
#############

The following examples demonstrate how to use the |sdk-net| to work with
individual AWS services.

Find the source code for these examples and others in the AWS documentation
`code examples repository on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples>`_. 
To propose a new code example for the AWS documentation team to consider producing,
create a new request.
The team is looking to produce code examples that cover broader scenarios and use cases,
versus simple code snippets that cover only individual API calls.
For instructions, see the *Proposing new code examples* section in the
`Readme on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/README.rst>`_. 

Additional samples are available on :github:`GitHub <awslabs/aws-sdk-net-samples>`.

Before you begin, be sure you have :ref:`set up the AWS SDK for .NET <net-dg-setup>` and review
:ref:`net-dg-programming-techniques`.
