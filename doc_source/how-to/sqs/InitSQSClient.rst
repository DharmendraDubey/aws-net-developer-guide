########################
Creating an |SQS| Client
########################

You need an |SQS| client in order to create and use an |SQS| queue. Before configuring your
client, you should create an :file:`App.Config` file to specify your AWS credentials.

You specify your credentials by referencing the appropriate profile in the :code:`appSettings` section
of the file.

The following example specifies a profile named :code:`my_profile`. For more information
about credentials and profiles, see :ref:`net-dg-config`.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <configuration>
      <configSections>
        <section name="aws" type="Amazon.AWSSection, AWSSDK.Core"/>
      </configSections>
      <aws profileName="my_profile"/>
      <startup>
        <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.0"/>
      </startup>
    </configuration>


After you create this file, you're ready to create and initialize your |SQS| client.

.. topic:: To create and initialize an |SQS| client

    #. Create and initialize an :sdk-net-api:`AmazonSQSConfig <SQS/TSQSConfig>` instance, and then set the
       :code:`ServiceURL` property with the protocol and service endpoint, as follows.

       .. code-block:: csharp

           var sqsConfig = new AmazonSQSConfig();

           sqsConfig.ServiceURL = "http://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com";


    #. Use the :classname:`AmazonSQSConfig` instance to create and initialize an
       :sdk-net-api:`AmazonSQSClient <SQS/TSQSClient>` instance, as follows.

       .. code-block:: csharp

          var sqsClient = new AmazonSQSClient(sqsConfig);

    You can now use the client to create an |SQS| queue. For information about creating a queue, see
    :ref:`create-sqs-queue`.
