######################
Create an |SQS| Client
######################

You will need an |SQS| client in order to create and use an |SQS| queue. Before configuring your
client, you should create an :file:`App.Config` file to specify your AWS credentials.

You specify your credentials by referencing the appropriate profile in the appSettings section of
the file. The following example specifies a profile named {my_profile}. For more information on
credentials and profiles, see :ref:`net-dg-config`.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?> 
      <configuration> 
        <startup> 
          <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.0"/> 
        </startup> 
        <configSections> 
          <section name="aws" type="Amazon.AWSSection, AWSSDK"/> 
        </configSections> <aws profileName="{my_profile}"/>
      </configuration>

After you create this file, you are ready to create and initialize your |SQS| client.

**To create and initialize an Amazon SQS client**

1. Create and initialize an :sdk-net-api-v2:`AmazonSQSConfig <TSQSSQSConfigNET45>` instance, and set the
   :sdk-net-api-v2:`ServiceURL <PRuntimeClientConfigServiceURLNET45>` property with the protocol and service
   endpoint, as follows:

   .. code-block:: csharp

       AmazonSQSConfig amazonSQSConfig = new AmazonSQSConfig();
           
       amazonSQSConfig.ServiceURL = "http://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com";

   .. code-block:: csharp

       AmazonSQSConfig amazonSQSConfig = new AmazonSQSConfig();
           
       amazonSQSConfig.ServiceURL = "http://sqs.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com";

   The |sdk-net| uses |useast1-name| as the default region if you do not specify a region in your
   code. However, the |console| uses |uswest2-name| as its default. Therefore, when using the
   |console| in conjunction with your development, be sure to specify the same region in both your
   code and the console.

   Go to |regions-and-endpoints|_ for the current list of regions and corresponding endpoints
   for each of the services offered by AWS.

2. Use the :code:`AmazonSQSConfig` instance to create and initialize an :sdk-net-api-v2:`AmazonSQSClient
   <TSQSSQSNET45>` instance, as follows:

   .. code-block:: csharp

       amazonSQSClient = new AmazonSQSClient(amazonSQSConfig);

You can now use the client to create an |SQS| queue. For information about creating a queue, see
:ref:`create-sqs-queue`.
