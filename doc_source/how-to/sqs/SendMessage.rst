########################
Sending an |SQS| Message
########################

You can use the |sdk-net| to send a message to an |SQS| queue.

.. important:: Due to the distributed nature of the queue, |SQS| can't guarantee you will receive
   messages in the precise order they are sent. If you need to preserve the message order,
   use an |SQS| FIFO queue.
   For information about FIFO queues, see :sqs-dg:`Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Queues<FIFO-queues>`.

.. topic:: To send a message to an |SQS| queue

    #. Create and initialize a :sdk-net-api:`SendMessageRequest <SQS/TSendMessageRequest>` instance.
       Specify the queue name and the message you want to send, as follows.

       .. code-block:: csharp

          sendMessageRequest.QueueUrl = myQueueURL; sendMessageRequest.MessageBody = "{YOUR_QUEUE_MESSAGE}";

       For more information about your queue URL, see :ref:`sqs-queue-url`.

       Each queue message must be composed of Unicode characters only, and can be up to 64 KB in size.
       For more information about queue messages, see :sqs-api:`SendMessage` in the |SQS-api|.

    #. After you create the request, pass it as a parameter to the
       :sdk-net-api:`SendMessage <SQS/MSQSSendMessageSendMessageRequest>` method.
       The method returns a :sdk-net-api:`SendMessageResponse <SQS/TSendMessageResponse>` object,
       as follows.

       .. code-block:: csharp

          var sendMessageResponse = sqsClient.SendMessage(sendMessageRequest);

       The sent message will stay in your queue until the visibility timeout is exceeded,
       or until it is deleted from the queue. For more information about visibility timeouts,
       go to :sqs-dg:`Visibility Timeout <AboutVT>`.

    For information about deleting messages from your queue, see :ref:`delete-sqs-message`.

    For information about receiving messages from your queue, see :ref:`receive-sqs-message`.
