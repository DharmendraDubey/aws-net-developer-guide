Using Elastic IP Addresses in |EC2|
###################################

.. meta::
   :description: Use this .NET code example to learn how to work with Elastic IP addresses in Amazon EC2.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for .NET examples, Elastic IP addresses

This .NET example shows you how to:

* Retrieve descriptions of your Elastic IP addresses
* Allocate and associate an Elastic IP address with an |EC2| instance
* Release an Elastic IP address

The Scenario
============

An Elastic IP address is a static IP address designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address
is associated with your AWS account, and is a public IP address reachable from the Internet.

If your |EC2| instance doesn't have a public IP address, you can associate an Elastic IP address  with
your instance to enable communication with the Internet.

In this example, you use the |sdk-net| to manage Elastic IP addresses by using these methods of the
|EC2| client class:

* :sdk-net-api:`DescribeAddresses <EC2/MEC2DescribeAddressesDescribeAddressesRequest>`
* :sdk-net-api:`AllocateAddress <EC2/MEC2AllocateAddressAllocateAddressRequest>`
* :sdk-net-api:`AssociateAddress <EC2/MEC2AssociateAddressAssociateAddressRequest>`
* :sdk-net-api:`ReleaseAddress <EC2/MEC2ReleaseAddressReleaseAddressRequest>`


For more information about Elastic IP addresses in |EC2|, see
:ec2-ug-win:`Elastic IP Addresses <elastic-ip-addresses-eip>` in the |EC2-ug-win|.

Describe Elastic IP Addresses
=============================

Create an :sdk-net-api:`AmazonEC2Client <EC2/TEC2Client>` object. Next, create a :sdk-net-api:`DescribeAddressesRequest <EC2/TDescribeAddressesRequest>`
object to pass as a parameter, filtering the addresses returned by those in your VPC. To retrieve descriptions
of all your Elastic IP addresses, omit the filter from the parameters.
Then call the :sdk-net-api:`DescribeAddresses <EC2/MEC2DescribeAddressesDescribeAddressesRequest>`
method of the :code:`AmazonEC2Client` object.

.. code-block:: csharp

        public void DescribeElasticIps()
        {
            using (var client = new AmazonEC2Client(RegionEndpoint.USWest2))
            {
                var addresses = client.DescribeAddresses(new DescribeAddressesRequest
                {
                    Filters = new List<Filter>
                    {
                        new Filter
                        {
                            Name = "domain",
                            Values = new List<string> { "vpc" }
                        }
                    }
                }).Addresses;

                foreach(var address in addresses)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(address.PublicIp);
                    Console.WriteLine("\tAllocation Id: " + address.AllocationId);
                    Console.WriteLine("\tPrivate IP Address: " + address.PrivateIpAddress);
                    Console.WriteLine("\tAssociation Id: " + address.AssociationId);
                    Console.WriteLine("\tInstance Id: " + address.InstanceId);
                    Console.WriteLine("\tNetwork Interface Owner Id: " + address.NetworkInterfaceOwnerId);
                }
            }
        }



Allocate and Associate an Elastic IP Address
============================================

Create an :sdk-net-api:`AmazonEC2Client <EC2/TEC2Client>` object. Next, create an :sdk-net-api:`AllocateAddressRequest <EC2/TAllocateAddressRequest>`
object for the parameter used to allocate an Elastic IP address, which in this case specifies that the
domain is a VPC. Call the :sdk-net-api:`AllocateAddress <EC2/MEC2AllocateAddressAllocateAddressRequest>` method of the
:code:`AmazonEC2Client` object.

Upon success, the returned :sdk-net-api:`AllocateAddressResponse <EC2/TAllocateAddressResponse>` object
has an :code:`AllocationId` property that identifies the allocated Elastic IP address.

Create an :sdk-net-api:`AssociateAddressRequest <EC2/TAssociateAddressRequest>` object for the parameters
used to associate an Elastic IP address to an |EC2| instance. Include the :code:`AllocationId` from the
newly allocated address and the :code:`InstanceId` of the |EC2| instance. Then call the
:sdk-net-api:`AssociateAddress <EC2/MEC2AssociateAddressAssociateAddressRequest>` method of
the :code:`AmazonEC2Client` object.

.. code-block:: csharp

        public void AllocateAndAssociate(string instanceId)
        {
            using (var client = new AmazonEC2Client(RegionEndpoint.USWest2))
            {
                var allocationId = client.AllocateAddress(new AllocateAddressRequest
                {
                    Domain = DomainType.Vpc
                }).AllocationId;

                Console.WriteLine("Allocation Id: " + allocationId);

                var associationId = client.AssociateAddress(new AssociateAddressRequest
                {
                    AllocationId = allocationId,
                    InstanceId = instanceId
                }).AssociationId;

                Console.WriteLine("Association Id: " + associationId);
            }
        }



Release an Elastic IP Address
=============================

Create an :sdk-net-api:`AmazonEC2Client <EC2/TEC2Client>` object. Next, create a :sdk-net-api:`ReleaseAddressRequest <EC2/TReleaseAddressRequest>`
object for the parameters used to release an Elastic IP address, which in this case specifies the
:code:`AllocationId` for the Elastic IP address. Releasing an Elastic IP address also disassociates it
from any |EC2| instance. Call the :sdk-net-api:`ReleaseAddress <EC2/MEC2ReleaseAddressReleaseAddressRequest>`
method
of the |EC2| service object.

.. code-block:: csharp

        public void Release(string allocationId)
        {
            using (var client = new AmazonEC2Client(RegionEndpoint.USWest2))
            {
                client.ReleaseAddress(new ReleaseAddressRequest
                {
                    AllocationId = allocationId
                });
            }
        }
