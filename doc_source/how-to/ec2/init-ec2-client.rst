   :description: Use this .NET code example to learn how to create an Amazon EC2 client.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for .NET examples, EC2 clients


Create an |EC2| client to manage your EC2 resources, such as instances and security groups. This
client is represented by an :sdk-net-api:`AmazonEC2Client <EC2/TEC2Client>` object, which
you can create as follows.

.. code-block:: csharp

    var ec2Client = new AmazonEC2Client();

The permissions for the client object are determined by the policy attached to the profile you
specified in the :file:`App.config` file. By default, we use the region specified in
:file:`App.config`. To use a different region, pass the appropriate
:sdk-net-api:`RegionEndpoint <Amazon/TRegionEndpoint>` value to the constructor. For more information, see
:rande:`Regions and Endpoints: EC2 <ec2>` in the |AWS-gr|.
