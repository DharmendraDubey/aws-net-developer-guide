Create an AWS Account and Credentials
#####################################

To use the |sdk-net| to access AWS services, you need an AWS account and AWS credentials. To increase the
security of your AWS account, we recommend that you use an *IAM user* to provide access credentials
instead of using your root account credentials.

* To create an AWS account, see `How do I create and activate a new Amazon Web Services account? <https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account>`_.

* Avoid using your root user account to access services. For details , see `The AWS Account Root User <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html>`_.
  
* To deactivate your AWS account, see `Account Settings <https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/account>`_, scroll down to **Close Account** and follow the instructions.
