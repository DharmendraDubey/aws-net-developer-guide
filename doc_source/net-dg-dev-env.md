# Set Up the \.NET Development Environment<a name="net-dg-dev-env"></a>

To use the AWS SDK for \.NET, you must have the following installed\.

**Note**  
If you performed the [quick start for the SDK](quick-start.md), you might already have some of these tools installed\. If you didn't do the quick start and are new to \.NET development on AWS, consider doing that first for a gentle introduction to the AWS SDK for \.NET\.

**Required for cross\-platform \.NET development on Windows, Linux, or macOS:**
+ Microsoft [\.NET Core SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/), version 2\.1, 3\.1, or later, which includes the \.NET command line interface \(CLI\) \(**`dotnet`**\) and the \.NET Core runtime\.
+ A code editor or integrated development environment \(IDE\) that is appropriate for your operating system and requirements; typically one that provides some support for \.NET Core\.

  Examples include [Microsoft Visual Studio Code \(VS Code\)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), and [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)\.

**Required for development on Windows with Visual Studio and \.NET Core:**
+ [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
+ Microsoft \.NET Core 2\.1, 3\.1 or later

  This is typically included by default when installing a modern version of Visual Studio\.
+ \(Optional\) The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio, which is a plugin that provides a user interface for managing your AWS resources and local profiles from Visual Studio\. To install the toolkit, see [Setting Up the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/getting-set-up.html)\.
