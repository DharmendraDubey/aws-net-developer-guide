Configuring Your |sdk-net| Application
######################################

You can configure your |sdk-net| application to specify logging options, endpoints,
or signature version 4 support with |S3|.

The recommended way to configure an application is to use the :code:`<aws>` element in the project's
:file:`App.config` or :file:`Web.config` file. The following example specifies the
:ref:`config-setting-awsregion` and :ref:`config-setting-awslogging` parameters.

.. code-block:: xml

    <configuration>
      <configSections>
        <section name="aws" type="Amazon.AWSSection, AWSSDK.Core"/>
      </configSections>
      <aws region="us-west-2">
        <logging logTo="Log4Net"/>
      </aws>
    </configuration>

Another way to configure an application is to edit the :code:`<appSettings>` element in the
project's :file:`App.config` or :file:`Web.config` file. The following example specifies the
:ref:`config-setting-awsregion` and :ref:`config-setting-awslogging` parameters.

.. code-block:: xml

    <configuration>
      <appSettings>
        <add key="AWSRegion" value="us-west-2"/>
        <add key="AWSLogging" value="log4net"/>
      </appSettings>
    </configuration>

These settings take effect only after the application has been rebuilt.

Although you can configure an |sdk-net| application programmatically by setting property values in
the :sdk-net-api:`AWSConfigs <Amazon/TAWSConfigs>` class, we recommend you use the :code:`aws`
element instead. The following example specifies the :ref:`config-setting-awsregion` and
:ref:`config-setting-awslogging` parameters:

.. code-block:: csharp

    AWSConfigs.AWSRegion = "us-west-2";
    AWSConfigs.Logging = LoggingOptions.Log4Net;

Programmatically defined parameters override any values that were specified in an :file:`App.config`
or :file:`Web.config` file. Some programmatically defined parameter values take effect immediately;
others take effect only after you create a new client object.
