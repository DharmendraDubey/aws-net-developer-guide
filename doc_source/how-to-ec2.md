# Amazon EC2 Instances Examples<a name="how-to-ec2"></a>

You can access the features of Amazon EC2 using the AWS SDK for \.NET\. For example, you can create, start, and terminate Amazon EC2 instances\.

The sample code is written in C\#, but you can use the AWS SDK for \.NET with any compatible language\. When you install the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio a set of C\# project templates are installed\. So the easiest way to start this project is to open Visual Studio, and then choose **File**, **New Project**, **AWS Sample Projects**, **Compute and Networking**, **AWS EC2 Sample**\.

 **Prerequisites** 

Before you begin, be sure that you have created an AWS account and set up your AWS credentials\. For more information, see [Getting Started with the AWS SDK for \.NET](net-dg-setup.md)\.
