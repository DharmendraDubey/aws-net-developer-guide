#########################################
Configuring the |sdk-net| with |net-core|
#########################################

One of the biggest changes in |net-core| is the removal of :code:`ConfigurationManager` and the standard 
:file:`app.config` and :file:`web.config` files that were used ubiquitously with .NET Framework and 
ASP.NET applications. For traditional .NET applications, the |sdk-net| uses this configuration 
system to set things like AWS credentials and region so that you don't have to do this in code.

The configuration system in |net-core| allows any type of input source from any location. Also, the 
configuration object isn't a global singleton like the ConfigurationManager in standard .NET 
applications, so the |sdk-net| doesn't have access to read settings from it.

.. note:: For background on the |net-core| configuration system, read the 
   `Configuration <https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/fundamentals/configuration.html>`_ topic in the 
   |net-core| documentation.

To make it easy to use the |sdk-net| with |net-core|, you can use the 
:code:`AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup` NuGet package. Like many |net-core| libraries, it adds 
extension methods to the :code:`IConfiguration` interface to make getting the AWS configuration 
seamless.

.. _net-core-configuration-builder:

Using AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup
======================================

When you create an ASP.NET Core MVC application in Visual Studio, the constructor for :file:`Startup.cs` 
handles configuration by reading in various input sources, using the :code:`ConfigurationBuilder` 
and setting the :code:`Configuration` property to the built :code:`IConfiguration` object. 

.. literalinclude:: how-to/net-core/configurationBuilder.cs
   :language: csharp

To use the :code:`Configuration` object to get the AWS options, first add the 
:code:`AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup` NuGet package. Then, add your options to the configuration 
file. Notice one of the files added to the :code:`ConfigurationBuilder` is called 
:code:`$"appsettings.{env.EnvironmentName}.json"`. If you look at the Debug tab in your project's 
properties, you can see this file is set to **Development**. This works great for local testing 
because you can put your configuration in the :file:`appsettings.Development.json` file, which is 
read-only during local testing. When you deploy an |EC2| instance that has :code:`EnvironmentName` 
set to **Production**, this file is ignored and the |sdk-net| falls back to the IAM credentials 
and region configured for the |EC2| instance.

The configuration below shows an example of the values you can add in the 
:file:`appsettings.Development.json` file in your project to supply AWS settings. 

.. literalinclude:: how-to/net-core/appsettings-development.json
   :language: json
   
To access the AWS options set in the file from code, call the :code:`GetAWSOptions` extension method 
added on :code:`IConfiguration`. To construct a service client from these options, call 
:code:`CreateServiceClient`. The following example code shows how to create an |S3| service client. 

.. literalinclude:: how-to/net-core/create-s3-client.cs
   :language: csharp

You can also create multiple service clients with incompatible settings using multiple entries in the 
:file:`appsettings.Development.json` file, as shown in the following examples where the configuration for 
:code:`service1` includes the :code:`us-west-2` Region
and the configuration for :code:`service2` includes the special endpoint **URL**.

.. literalinclude:: how-to/net-core/appsettings-multiple.json
   :language: json
      
.. _net-core-appsettings-values:

Allowed Values in appsettings File
----------------------------------

The following app configuration values can be set in the :file:`appsettings.Development.json` file. 
The field names must use the casing shown in the list below. For details on these settings, refer to 
the :sdk-net-api:`AWS.Runtime.ClientConfg <Runtime/TClientConfig>` class.

* Region
* Profile
* ProfilesLocation
* SignatureVersion
* RegionEndpoint
* UseHttp
* ServiceURL
* AuthenticationRegion
* AuthenticationServiceName
* MaxErrorRetry
* LogResponse
* BufferSize
* ProgressUpdateInterval
* ResignRetries
* AllowAutoRedirect
* LogMetrics
* DisableLogging
* UseDualstackEndpoint

   
.. _net-core-dependency-injection:

ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection 
=================================

The *AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup* NuGet package also integrates with a new dependency injection 
system in ASP.NET Core. The :code:`ConfigureServices` method in :code:`Startup` is where the MVC 
services are added. If the application is using Entity Framework, this is also where that is 
initialized. 

.. literalinclude:: how-to/net-core/configureServices.cs
   :language: csharp
   
.. note:: Background on dependency injection in |net-core| is available on the |net-core| 
   `documentation site <https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/fundamentals/dependency-injection.html>`_. 

The :code:`AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup` NuGet package adds new extension methods to 
:code:`IServiceCollection` that you can use to add AWS services to the dependency injection. The 
following code shows how to add the AWS options that are read from :code:`IConfiguration` to add 
|S3| and |DDB| to our list of services. 

.. literalinclude:: how-to/net-core/configureAwsServices.cs
   :language: csharp
   
Now, if your MVC controllers use either :code:`IAmazonS3` or :code:`IAmazonDynamoDB` as parameters 
in their constructors, the dependency injection system passes in those services. 
   
.. literalinclude:: how-to/net-core/homeController.cs
   :language: csharp
