Install AWSSDK Assemblies
#########################

You can install the AWSSDK assemblies by installing the |sdk-net| or by installing
the AWS assemblies with NuGet.

.. note:: Avoid installing the :code:`AWSSDK.Core` assembly package (*AWSSDK.Core.dll*) in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).
   Doing so will make it more difficult to use different versions of the |sdk-net|.

.. _net-dg-install-net-sdk:

Installing the |sdk-net|
========================

The following procedure describes how to install the |sdk-net|, which contains the |sdk-net|, the |TVSlong|, 
and the |TWP|.

.. tip:: The |sdk-net| is also available on `GitHub <https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net>`_.

.. topic:: To install the |sdk-net|

    #. Go to |sdk-net|_.

    #. In the :guilabel:`Downloads` section, choose :guilabel:`Download MSI Installer` to download the
       installer.

    #. To start installation, run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

        .. tip:: By default, the |sdk-net| is installed in the Program Files directory, which requires
           administrator privileges. To install the |sdk-net| as a non-administrator, choose a different
           installation directory.

    #. (Optional) You can use NuGet to install individual AWSSDK service assemblies and extensions
       for the |sdk-net|, which include a session state provider and a trace listener. For more
       information, see :ref:`net-dg-nuget`.


.. _net-dg-nuget:

Installing AWSSDK Assemblies with NuGet
=======================================

`NuGet <http://nuget.org/>`_ is a package management system for the .NET platform. With NuGet, you
can add the AWSSDK assemblies, as well as the
`TraceListener <http://www.nuget.org/packages/AWS.TraceListener>`_ and
`SessionProvider <http://www.nuget.org/packages/AWS.SessionProvider>`_ extensions, to your
application.

NuGet always has the most recent versions of the AWSSDK assemblies, and also enables you to install
previous versions. NuGet is aware of dependencies between assemblies and installs all required
assemblies automatically. Assemblies installed with NuGet are stored with your solution instead of
in a central location, such as in the Program Files directory. This enables you to install assembly
versions specific to a given application without creating compatibility issues for other applications.
For more information about NuGet, see the `NuGet documentation <http://docs.nuget.org/>`_.

NuGet is installed automatically with Visual Studio 2010 or later.
If you are using an earlier version of Visual Studio, you can install NuGet from the
`Visual Studio Gallery on MSDN
<http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/27077b70-9dad-4c64-adcf-c7cf6bc9970c>`_.

You can use NuGet from :guilabel:`Solution Explorer` or from the Package Manager
Console.

NuGet AWSSDK Packages
---------------------

The NuGet website provides a page for every package available through NuGet. The page for each
package includes a sample command line for installing the package using the Package Manager Console.
Each page also includes a list of the previous versions of the package that are available through
NuGet. For a list of AWSSDK packages available from NuGet, see `AWSSDK Packages
<http://www.nuget.org/profiles/awsdotnet>`_.

Using NuGet from Solution Explorer
----------------------------------

.. topic:: To use NuGet from Solution Explorer

    #. In :guilabel:`Solution Explorer`, right-click your project, and then choose :guilabel:`Manage
       NuGet Packages` from the context menu.

    #. In the left pane of the :guilabel:`Manage NuGet Packages` dialog box, choose
       :guilabel:`Online`.  You can then use the search box in the top-right corner to search for
       the package you want to install.

       The following figure shows the :guilabel:`AWSSDK - Core Runtime` assembly package. You can
       see NuGet is aware that this package has a dependency on the :code:`AWSSDK.Core` assembly
       package; NuGet automatically installs the :code:`AWSSDK.Core` package, if it is not already
       installed.

.. _package-install-cmd:

Using NuGet from the Package Manager Console
--------------------------------------------

.. topic:: To use NuGet from the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio

    * *Visual Studio 2010*

      From the :guilabel:`Tools` menu, choose :guilabel:`Library Package Manager`, and then click
      :guilabel:`Package Manager Console`.

    * *Visual Studio 2012 and later*

      From the :guilabel:`Tools` menu, choose :guilabel:`Nuget Package Manager`, and then click
      :guilabel:`Package Manager Console`.

You can install the AWSSDK assemblies you want from the Package Manager Console by using the
:command:`Install-Package` command. For example, to install the `AWSSDK.AutoScaling
<http://www.nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK.AutoScaling>`_ assembly, use the following command.

.. code-block:: sh

    PM> Install-Package AWSSDK.AutoScaling

NuGet also installs any dependencies, such as `AWSSDK.Core
<http://www.nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK.Core>`_.

To install an earlier version of a package, use the :code:`-Version` option and specify the
package version you want. For example, to install version 3.1.0.0 of the |sdk-net| assembly, use the
following command line.

.. code-block:: sh

    PM> Install-Package AWSSDK.Core -Version 3.1.0.0

`Package Manager Console Commands (v1.3)
<http://nuget.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Package%20Manager%20Console%20Command%20Reference%20%28v1.3%29>`_.
