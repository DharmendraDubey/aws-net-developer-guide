   :keywords: AWS SDK for .NET examples, SQS


The |sdk-net|_ supports |SQS|, which is a message queuing service that handles messages or
workflows between components in a system. For more information, see |SQS|_.

The following examples demonstrate how to use the |sdk-net| to create and use |SQS| queues.

The sample code is written in C#, but you can use the |sdk-net| with any compatible
language. The |sdk-net| installs a set of C# project templates.

**Prerequisite Tasks**

Before you begin, be sure that you have created an AWS account and set up your AWS credentials. For
more information, see :ref:`net-dg-setup`.

For related API reference information, see :sdk-net-api:`Amazon.SQS <SQS/NSQS>`,
:sdk-net-api:`Amazon.SQS.Model <SQS/NSQSModel>`, and
:sdk-net-api:`Amazon.SQS.Util <SQS/NSQSUtil>` in the |sdk-net-ref|.
