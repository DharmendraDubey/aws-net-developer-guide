# Start a New Project<a name="net-dg-start-new-project"></a>

There are several techniques you can use to start a new project that accesses AWS services\. A few of those techniques are shown below\.
+ You can start a basic project by using the \.NET CLI\. To see this, open a command line or terminal, create a new folder or directory and go there, and then type:

  **`dotnet new console`**

  A simple "hello world" project is created to which you can add code and NuGet packages\. For more information, see the [\.NET Core guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/)\.
+ The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio includes C\# project templates for a variety of AWS services\. After you have [installed the toolkit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/setup.html) in Visual Studio, you can access the templates while creating a new project\.

  To see this, go to [Working with AWS Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/working-with-services.html) in the *[AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSToolkitVS/latest/UserGuide/)*\. Several of the examples in that topic create new projects\.
